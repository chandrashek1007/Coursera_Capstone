# Coursera_Capstone
In this project I have implemented Capstone Project using Python libraries pandas,sklearn,matplotlib,seaborn,numpy,scipy.
I have worked on the following steps:

1. Data Collections
2. Data Preparation
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Data Visualizations
5. Machine Learning
6. Model Evaluation

At last I summarised the entire Capstone Project with Model Evaluation Metrics.
